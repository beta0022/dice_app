![rol the dice app](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12IpTKhg9xa57TpA16yFzmpS0JF-Kz32a/view?usp=share_link)

My first Flutter app to roll the dice from anywhere. The dice have six sides, showing a different number of dots randomly from 1 to 6 every time you click the button. I work on this project to learn the basics of Flutter and Dart.
